Brachions
=========

**Tattooed, six-armed warriors who await the coming of their God-king.**

**Basic Concept**: Feel superior to Allos, Legends speak of a great leader  
**Appearance**: Arms (many), Memories (long)  
**Reputation**: Decadent, Uncivilized  

The Brachion are hairless, humanoid, and have six arms that they famously use to wield multiple knives in combat. Their history—personal, familial, and cultural—is literally written on their bodies in white tattoos that contrast starkly with their ebony black skin.

A once great Folk—ruling an empire that spanned Volumes—they have fallen in power and prominence and now live as primitive tribes scattered across the Down. Their former servants, the Allos, are still looked down upon. Brachion legend tells of a two-armed God-king who will arise from the Everpool to unite their scattered people, defeat their enemies, and usher in a new age.
