Allos
=====

**Massive, mutated humanoids reverently collect, catalog, and consume Fungi.**

**Basic Concept**: Disgusted by Brachions, Worship Fungus  
**Appearance**: Huge, Hybrids and mutants  
**Reputation**: Dour, Introspective  

Standing over 12 feet tall, the Allos are massive, misshapen, and mutated due to the toxic Fungi they worshipfully smoke. Fungi of all forms are holy to them, but the Fungal infusions of the Everpool are the holy of holies. Bathing there is a pilgrimage that all Allos are expected to make at least once in their lives. More interested in inner spirituality, they are laconic and impatient with others.

The Allos were once the slaves of the Brachions, whom they regard as unclean. To the Allos, Brachion bathing in the sacred pool is blasphemous.

## Relationships with Other Folk

Think grumpy old man. Doesn't want to be bothered. Perfectly fine neighbors but they tend not to make friends outside of their own.

## Relationship with the Brachion

Hatred and disgust. The Brachions are arrogrant, aggressive, and still view Allos as subcreatures. While Allos won't go out of their way to use violence against one, if they are in their space, they also won't hesitate. See the Brachions as unclean.
