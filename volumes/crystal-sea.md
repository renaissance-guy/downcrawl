Crystal Sea
===========

Underwater and cosmopolitain cities of crystal, ruled by insubstantial priests. Grinning catfish laze through the deep, creating elaborate patterns in the sand. Artworks in the deeps, complex patterns of sand. The insubstantial priest make all the stuff, useless to them, for the catfish. The catfish build the artwork that is the basis of religion. The shadow beast interpret the art and make predictions. The predictiopns are not always nice. (scary) Hot vents at the bottom are a problem

Cystal formations everywhere under the sea, clustered around hot vents. Cystal is needed for art, to maintain the city, to house the priest-lord.
