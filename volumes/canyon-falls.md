Canyon Falls
============

**Zealots fight in an ancient and alien city that looms in forgotten canyons.**

**Themes**: Rival Forces, Weird City  
**Terrain**: Verticle Rivers, Winding Canyons  
**Abundant**: Fungi, Religion, Water  
**Scarce**: Trade, Wealth  
**Remoteness**: Secret  

There are few entrances, and fewer visitors to these deep and winding ravines. Torrents, streams, and dribbles fall thousands of feet from openings far above before flowing along the mesas, walls, and canyon floors. Along the shores of these flows grow Fungi, becoming ever more fecund as the rivers join and widen and eventually enter the City.

No one knows the name of the the City. It is merely the City. Its buildings are tall, rounded, metallic, and alien. Sleek, slick, and covered with fungal growth, there are no openings. They are blood-warm to the touch and a faint double pulsing can be felt beneath their surface.

Some say the buildings of the City look alive. Others say they *are* alive. If you look at a building, turn, and look again, sometimes it changes. Sometimes it might even open. But if you dare to enter, hurry, lest you be trapped within.

Wide canals, glowing with minature luminescent life, flow through the city, between the buildingsm, and toward the center of the city. Narrow walkways, slick with moisture and growth, follow alongside the canals with an occasional bridge over, or set of stairs down to, the water.

Not far outside—and on opposite sides of—the City, the [Allos](../folk/allos.md) and [Brachions](../folk/brachions.md) live in tents and pavillions pitched along the shores of two of the widest rivers that flow into and between the dark towers of the City. The Allos and the Brachions both believe the City to be a holy site and send pilgrims to bathe in the living water of Everpool at the center of the city.

The Brachions are crude, uncivilized, and understand perfectly that they are superior to the mutated and mishappen Allos. The Allos, taciturn and surly, have no words and no patience for the uncouth Brachions. More than pilgrims, both sides send warriors and conflict is common. The flow of blood is often added to the flow of water between the metallic spires.

## Touchstone

**The Everpool** All of the flows through the city come to a single lake in the center. Ringed with building, the metalic quay has numerous bridges over the wide glowing river river. Stairs lead down like a conversation pit, inviting. The varous colors of glow merge and swiril in teh water. Glowing motes move through the water. But the current is strong and in the center of the lake a large laminar flow of water whirlpool dumps the contents of the lake to unknow depths.

Each come and bath in the water at the central pit, and the fungal infusions there will grant a boon to those who swim there. But the undertow is strong and many are pulled under, never to be seen again.

Table for random water effect. Swim risk rules.
