Canyon Falls
============

**Rivals fight over an ancient and alien city in a forgotten network of canyons.**

**Themes**: Rival Forces, Weird City  
**Terrain**: Verticle Rivers, Winding Canyons  
**Abundant**: Fungi, Religion, Water  
**Scarce**: Trade, Wealth  
**Remoteness**: Secret  

There are few entrances, and fewer visitors to these deep and winding ravines. Torrents, streams, and dribbles fall thousands of feet from openings far above before flowing along the mesas, walls, and canyon floors. Along the shores of these flows grow Fungi, becoming ever more fecund as the rivers join and widen and eventually enter the City.

No one knows the name of the the City. It is merely the City. The buildings are tall, rounded, metallic, and alien. Sleek, slick, and covered with fungal growth, there are no openings. The buildings are blood-warm to the touch and a faint double pulsing can be felt beneath the surface.

Some say the buildings of the City look alive. Others say they *are* alive. If you look at a building, turn, and look again, sometimes they change. Sometimes they even open. But if you dare to enter, hurry, lest you be trapped within.

Wide canals, glowing with minature luminescent life, flow through the city and toward the center, dividing the buildings. Narrow walkways, slick with moisture and growth, follow the canals. Some lead to bridges over, or stairs down to, the water.

Not far outside and on opposite sides of the City, the [Allos](../folk/allos.md) and [Brachions](../folk/brachions.md) live in tents and pavillions pitched along the shores of two of the widest rivers that flow into and between the dark towers of the City. The Allos and the Brachions both believe the City to be a holy site and send pilgrims to bathe in the living water at the center.

The Brachions are crude and uncivilized, and understand that they are superior to the mutated and mishappen Allos. The Allos, taciturn and surly, have no words and no patience for the uncouth Brachions. In additiona to pilgrims, both sides send warriors, to stop pilgrims and toi protect them. Conflict is common, and the flow of blood is often added to the flow of water to the center.

## Touchstone

Each come and bath in the water at the central pit, and the fungal infusions there will grant a boon to those who swim there. But the undertow is strong and many are pulled under, never to be seen again.

The flow of the canals lead to a central pond, devoid of buildings, Fungi, walkways, or anything but stone. The middle of the pond is a 

The waters all flow into the city along canals and ultimately to a central pit in the center of the city. The the bottom of the pit cannot be seen, yet it glows with luminescence fungus.
