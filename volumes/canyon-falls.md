**Rivals fight over an ancient and alien city in a forgotten network of canyons.**

There are few entrances, and fewer visitors to these deep and winding ravines. Torrents, streams, and dribbles fall thousands of feet from openings far above before flowing along the mesas, walls, and canyon floors. Along the shores of these flows grow Fungi, becoming ever more fecund as the rivers join and widen and eventually enter the City.

No one knows the name of the the City. It is merely the City. The buildings are tall, rounded, metallic, and alien. Sleek, slick, and covered with fungal growth, there are no openings. The buildings are blood-warm to the touch and a faint double pulsing can be felt beneath the surface.

Some say the buildings of the City look alive. Others say they *are* alive. If you look at a building, turn, and look again, the patterns can sometimes change. None of the building have opening, but when you're not looking, sometimes they open. Hurry in and hurry out lest you be trapped forever.

Wide canals, glowing with minature luminescent life, flow through the city, dividing the buildings. Narrow walkways, slick with moisture and growth, follow the canals with an occasional bridge over or stairs leading down to the water.



The Brachions and the Allos both believe this to be a holy site. The Brachions are crude and uncivilized but think themselve superior to the mutated Allos. The dour Allos have no patient with the uncouth Brachions. Each come and bath in the water at the central pit, and the fungal infusions there will grant a boon to those who swim there. But the undertow is strong and many are pulled under, never to be seen again.

The two factions live outside of the city in the canyons, each in their own camp. They send warriors to try to stop the pilgrims from either camp from approaching the city.

The flow of the canals lead to a central pond, devoid of buildings, Fungi, walkways, or anything but stone. The middle of the pond is a 

The waters all flow into the city along canals and ultimately to a central pit in the center of the city. The the bottom of the pit cannot be seen, yet it glows with luminescence fungus.
