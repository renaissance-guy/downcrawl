Canyon Falls
============

**Zealots fight in an ancient and alien city that looms in forgotten canyons.**

**Themes**: Rival Forces, Weird City  
**Terrain**: Verticle Rivers, Winding Canyons  
**Abundant**: Fungi, Religion, Water  
**Scarce**: Trade, Wealth  
**Remoteness**: Secret  

There are few entrances, and fewer visitors, to these deep and meandering ravines. Torrents, streams, and dribbles fall thousands of feet from openings far above before flowing along the mesas, walls, and canyon floors. Along the shores of these flows grow Fungi, becoming ever more fecund as the rivers join and widen and eventually enter the City.

No one knows the name of the City. It is merely the City. Its buildings are tall, rounded, metallic, and alien. Sleek, slick, and covered with fungal growth, there are no openings. They are blood-warm to the touch and a faint double pulsing can be felt beneath their surface.

Some say the buildings of the City look alive. Others say they *are* alive. If you look at a building, turn, and look again, sometimes it changes. Sometimes it might even open. But if you dare to enter, hurry, lest you be trapped within.

Wide canals, glowing with miniature luminescent life, flow through the City, between the buildings, and toward the City's center. Narrow walkways, slick with moisture and growth, follow alongside the canals with an occasional bridge over or set of stairs down to, the water.

Not far outside—and on opposite sides of—the City, the [Allos](#allos) and the [Brachion](#brachion) live in tents and pavilions pitched along the shores of two of the widest rivers that flow into and between the dark towers of the City. Both groups believe the City to be a holy site and send pilgrims to bathe in the living water of the Everpool at the center of the City.

The Brachion are crude, uncivilized, and understand perfectly that they are superior to the mutated and mishappen Allos. The Allos, taciturn and surly, have no words and no patience for the uncouth Brachions. More than just pilgrims, both sides send warriors into the City. Conflict is common. The dark flow of blood is often added to the glowing flow of water between the strange towers.

## Touchstone

### The Everpool

All of the canals in the City ultimately come to a single, central, and perfectly circular reservoir hundreds of feet in diameter. The walkways terminate at an enormous, stepped quay ringing the Everpool and inviting visitors to enter. Bridges connect the ring where the canals enter. Various colors of glow flow and merge at the edges of the Everpool, speckled with bright motes. At the center is a hole in the water where a calm yet powerful laminar flow takes from the reservoir what the canals put in, dumping it beyond sight into unknowable depths.

Bathing in the water induces deeply meaningful hallucinations and creates a random Fungal Effect. However, there is risk as the current is strong and the hole in the water is impossibly deep. Only the brave, the foolish, or the true believer willing swim in the waters of the Everpool.

## Folk

### Allos

**Basic Concept**: Disgusted by Brachions, Worship Fungus  
**Appearance**: Huge, Hybrids and mutants  
**Reputation**: Dour, Introspective  

Standing over 12 feet tall, the Allos are massive, misshapen, and mutated due to the toxic Fungi they worshipfully smoke. Fungi of all forms are holy to them, but the Fungal infusions of the Everpool are the holy of holies. Bathing there is a pilgrimage that all Allos are expected to make at least once in their lives. More interested in inner spirituality, they are laconic and impatient with others.

The Allos were once the slaves of the Brachions, whom they regard as unclean. To the Allos, Brachion bathing in the sacred pool is blasphemous.

### Brachion

**Basic Concept**: Feel superior to Allos, Legends speak of a great leader  
**Appearance**: Arms (many), Memories (long)  
**Reputation**: Decadent, Uncivilized  

The Brachion are hairless, humanoid, and have six arms that they famously use to wield multiple knives in combat. Their history—personal, familial, and cultural—is literally written on their bodies in white tattoos that contrast starkly with their ebony black skin.

A once great Folk—ruling an empire that spanned Volumes—they have fallen in power and prominence and now live as primitive tribes scattered across the Down. Their former servants, the Allos, are still looked down upon. Brachion legend tells of a two-armed God-king who will arise from the Everpool to unite their scattered people, defeat their enemies, and usher in a new age.

## People

### Ji-rab
Mute leader of the Brachions. She communicates using Fuzz.

### Son-rab
Mystic who has amputated four of his arms—three on the right and one on the left—believing he is the prophesized God-king. Frequently bathes in the Everpool. Could he be the one?

### Ormon
Outcast Allos heretic trying to bring peace between the Allos and the Brachions. He has more supporters than believed.

### Umatrum
High priest of the Allos camp. Very knowledgeable about Fungi. Seeks someone brave (or foolish) to seek a particularly hard-to-find Fungus.

## Places

### Cave of Knowledge
Wise and telepathic Fungi share their knowledge with those who make the proper sacrifice. The Allos would believe this place holy if they knew of it.

### Fungal Circles
Rings of Fungi found throughout the canyons said to make magic less predictable—inhibiting, amplifying, and randomizing its effects.

### The Narrows
Narrow, shoreless flows with dangerous rapids. A predator lurks nearby.

### Hermit Falls
Box canyon with numerous and voluminous falls pouring over the edge. A deaf hermit of another Folk lives here.
