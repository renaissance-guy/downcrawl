Dyrhalla
========

Halls, lead to halls, lead to halls. Stalls in them all. Beds and shops and and bars. Behind the doors, natural caverns full of life. Some cold, some steamy, some fecund, some barren. Wild creatures in all. Folk gone wild sometime retreat to the caverns. Competing merchant houses harvest food, medicine, materials from the plants and animals that are found behind the doors and sell them. So many doors. So many caverns. So many creatures.
