Folk #2

Looks like a tranlucent orangatang with long arms and squat frames. Tranluscent skin, dark shapes, like organs, can be seen moving beneath their skin. Eschew wealth in favor of living in outside in the cold places, seeking a place to mate and leave their eggs among the fungi. Young vulnerable, so many of them, they eat the fungus to grow but it cancels their immunity to magic. Adults can tolerate the fungi but avoid drugs, for the same reason.

Concept:
Searching for the perfect Nesting Grounds
Can't come near drugs

Appearance: Shadows and translucences, Immune to magic
Reputation: Poor, Introspective

Immune to magic, consumption of drugs eliminates that immunity.
