Frostdale
=========

**Penitent worhip at a secluded monastery in the heart of a frigid fungal forest.**

**Themes**: Great City, University  
**Terrain**: Fungal Jungle, River System  
**Abundant**: Fungi, Drugs  
**Scarce**: Leaders, Heat  
**Remoteness**: Sheltered  

A network of icy rivers flows through these cold, high caves. The hoary growth is particularly dense here despite the cold—especially on the stony banks of the rivers. Luminescent Fungi radiate their frosty glow into narrow and overgrown paths that wind through their luminous fecundity. The cavernous ceilings are lost to darkness above the glow of the forest and—though well lit—the winding paths and thick growth combine with the looming dark to make Frostdale feel claustrophobic.

The rivers—the main way Folk travel through this Volume—are rocky, sluggish, and navigable. Small, open boats, piloted by Hutan boatfolk, ferry people and goods up and down the rivers—stopping at the occasional village or town. And, of course, at the city of Somphos.

Somphos is a walled city built and occupied by the Fitherskant. The wall serves not for defense from attack—for it has no rampart—but instead to keep the press of the Fungi at bay. The forest pushes right up to the very walls, growing even in the cracks and joints of the massive granite blocks that encompass the city.

Within the walls Somphos is a torch-lit maze of narrow streets and tall buildings, making the city and claustrophobic as the forest. In the streets and cramped public houses, Fitherskant can be found working and reveling at all hours.

The Allos are common in Somphos, and in all of the towns and villages within Frostdale. They collect Fungi, render them into Drugs, and use them either in prayer or turn a tidy profit. Drugs are easily found in Frostdale, particularly in Somphos, sold by Allos initiates and opportunists.

Most Hutan live a simple and tribal existence in the fungal forest where they forage, hunt wild beasts, and look for a place to lay their eggs. Some live in villages and towns, farming Fungi and raising beasts that they trade for scarce and made things from Somphos. And a few go to Somphos itself, either sell their farmed and foraged produce in bush markets or as servants of the Fitherskant.

The Fitherskant exploit the Hutan, using them to produce anything not made of stone or metal. In Somphos, Hutan work the docks, work the markets, and work to serve the Fitherskant.

## Somphos Docks

- outside of the city
- natural lake with wooden docks, boardwalk leading to the city walls.
- operated by Fitherskant, Hutan do all the work
- crude, rock walls and wooded 

## Mykos Monastery

In the heart of the forest, Allos monks tend their fungal fields, lead introspective and secluded lives, forage in the forest, and make their drugs and smoke their fungi. No desire for contact with the rest of the volume. The Hutan avoid this place as it nullifies their immunities. 

## Folk

### Allos

### Hutan

Guides and boatfolk. Villagers. Tribes.

Or as guides along through the forest and it's maze or trails.

Looks like a tranlucent orangatang with long arms and squat frames. Tranluscent skin, dark shapes, like organs, can be seen moving beneath their skin. Eschew wealth in favor of living in outside in the cold places, seeking a place to mate and leave their eggs among the fungi. Young vulnerable, so many of them, they eat the fungus to grow but it cancels their immunity to magic. Adults can tolerate the fungi but avoid drugs, for the same reason.

Concept:
Searching for the perfect Nesting Grounds
Can't come near drugs

Appearance: Shadows and translucences, Immune to magic
Reputation: Poor, Introspective

Immune to magic, consumption of drugs eliminates that immunity.

### Fitherskant

, famous city builders know across the Down

Concept: Exploit Hutan, Great makers in the domain of Infrastructure
Appearance: Smells sweet, Wings or feathers
Reputation: Industrious, Decadent

Bipedal. Body covered in dense, tawny feathers the keep them warm in the cold of Frostdale. Leathery vestigal wings poke out of their backs, apparently immune to the cold. Normally folded in but can be extended to radiate body heat in warmer places. Smell of cinnammon due to Fungi they smoke. Black eyes and a beaked mouth. 

Famous city builders. Indulgent. Work hard, Play hard. Build, smoke, work, drink. Take advatnage of the Hutan to grow all the food, they are busy working stone and metal.

## People

### Friends of the Forest
- A fringe Allos cult worships the Hutan as bearers of the Fungi and see themselves as unworthy of consuming it.

## Places

### Hexagonal Ruins
Hexagonal foundations of stone protrude from the fungal growth—ruins of a previous civilization. Who built them and what lies beneath?

### Abandoned Mines of Something
Centuries unused, this gem mines still yields treasure. Why was it abandoned?

### Village of Something
Rapids and a fall break the river here. A small, prosperous village tranships goods.

## Seeds

- Predatory flyers hide in the dark above, swooping down to attack. Perhaps they roost above?
